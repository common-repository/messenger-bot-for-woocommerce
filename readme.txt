= Why are the messenger checkbox and send to messenger button not displayed? =

If your FB-App is in development mode (The review process hasn't finished) only the FB-App Developers can see the Buttons while they are logged in into their Facebook Account.

= I still can't see the checkbox and send to Messenger Button =

Please go to the Plugin settings and resave the API Credentials. In most cases this solves the problem. Check if your url is show in the list of whitelisted domains (on the top of the plugin settings page)

= The Callback verification failed with HTTP Status Code 404 =

Go to Settings > Permalink and resave the Permalink settings. After this, try again.

= Where can I report bugs? =
